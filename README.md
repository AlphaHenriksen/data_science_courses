### Running the Code
To run the code, change the courses in *current_courses.csv* to fit those listed in your studyplanner. Until a feature is implemented to read the courses automatically from the studyplanner, the best course of action is to copy and past the courses into the csv file and make sure that each column has **tab-seperated** values.
